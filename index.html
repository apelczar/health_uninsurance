      <h1>Health (Un)Insurance in the US</h1>
      <h3>by Ali Pelczar</h3>
      <p class="subtitleText">
        In 2018, about 90% of all Americans under 65 had some form of health 
        insurance. The remainder, more than 28 million people, were uninsured. 
        Dive deeper into how that 10% is distributed across
        several dimensions, and how that number has changed over time.

            All states have seen a decrease in previous years in the 
            percent of residents uninsured. This primarily occurred
            in 2014 and 2015 when much of the Affordable Care Act
            came into effect.

            New Mexico saw the greatest absolute decrease during this
            time. It more than halved its uninsured rate, from 24% in
            2008 to 11% in 2018.

            Massachusetts implemented major health care reform in 2006
            and entered this period with an uninsured rate much lower
            than any other state. It has changed little since 2008.

            Meanwhile, Texas both started and ended this period
            with the highest uninsured rate in the country.

            Under the Affordable Care Act, states had the option to
            expand eligibility for Medicaid. By June 2019, these 34 
            states had chosen to do so.

        <div class="step" data-step="6">
          <p>
            The states that haven't expanded Medicaid are generally
            being left behind in terms of the uninsured rate.
